# Sum Arrays

Given an array of values, return the sum of the values.

## Business Rules/Errata

- Input must be an array.
- The array may be nested more than one level.
- All values must be integers.
- Solutions shall not use built in methods to flatten the array to one-dimension.

## Examples

One dimension:
```
sum_of_array([1,2,3,4,5]) => 15
```

Two dimensions:
```
sum_of_array([1,2,[1,2,3],4,5]) => 18
```

n dimensions: 

```
sum_of_array([1,[1,2,[3,4],5],[6,7]]) => 29
```
