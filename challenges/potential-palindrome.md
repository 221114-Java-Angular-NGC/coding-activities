# Potential Palindrome

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome. A palindrome is any string that can be read the same both forwards and backwards, such as "kayak".

## Business Rules/Errata

- You only need to determine whether it is possible to make a palindrome, you do not need to return an example of the palindrome.
- Any input that is not a string should be treated as a string, if possible.
- An empty string is not a palindrome.

## Examples

```bash
canMakePalindrome("carrace");  // True
```

The string `carrace` can be rearranged to make `racecar`, a palindrome.

## Tackling This Challenge

1. Make sure you've got the required software on your machine: A JDK 8+
2. If you haven't already, clone the CodingActivity repository.
3. Checkout a new branch using `git checkout -b yourgithubusername-wip`.
4. Add your code to a Java solution file and make the `canMakePalindrome` function work as expected.
5. Confirm your solution by making & running some unit tests.
6. If you've passed all the tests, push your changes to the repository for submission (be sure to send GitHub handle to trainer to get push permissions).

## Requirements

- JDK 8+
